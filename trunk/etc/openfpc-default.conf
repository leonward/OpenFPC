#
# This is a commented configuration file for an OpenFPC instance. Reading this
# file and making changes will allow you to get an OpenFPC instance up and 
# running quickly and simply.
#
# The format of this file is simple, comments must be on their own line 
# starting with a "#"
# E.g.
# VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE

# OpenFPC Instance configuration
# These are general settings that control how this instance functions and how 
# it is identified.
#
# NODENAME:     Unique name for this OpenFPC Instance
NODENAME=Default_Node

# PROXY:        OpenFPC operates in one of two modes:
# "Node":       An instance of OpenFPC where traffic/Session data is captured
# "Proxy":      A Proxy for one or more other OpenFPC Instances. An OpenFPC 
#		proxy doesn't perform an packet or session capture. It just 
#               proxies extraction requests. Set PROXY=1 to function as an 
#               OpenFPC Proxy.
PROXY=0

# DESCRIPTION:  A text string that describes this node. Used in reports, status 
#               updates, and other sensible places. One line of text, spaces
#               allowed  but must be in quotes "like this". 
DESCRIPTION="An OpenFPC node. www.openfpc.org"

# OFPC_ENABLED: Enable/Disable this instance. This allows you to take OpenFPC 
#               instances offline. This must be set to "y" for this instance
#               to start up.
OFPC_ENABLED=y

# SAVEDIR:      Temp directory to save extracted sessions to. Extracted data is
#               saved on the OpenFPC node along with a report of the request.
SAVEDIR=/tmp

# OFPC_PORT:    TCP port for the OpenFPC Queue Daemon listener. 
OFPC_PORT=4242

# NODEROUTE:    Filename to read in routing information. Only valid for an 
#               OpenFPC Proxy.
#NODEROUTE=

# KEEPFILES:	Keep files that are extracted by this instance in the $SAVEDIR.
#		Only has an impact on fetch actions, store will be kept	anyway
KEEPFILES=0


###############################################################################
# Packet capture
# Settings for the packet capture process. OpenFPC uses Sourcefire's 
# Daemonlogger tool for sniffing and recording packets. Karma to Marty Roesch
# for creating it.

# INTERFACE:    Interface name to capture packets from. 
INTERFACE=eth0

# FILE_SIZE:    Size of each PCAP file. 1G is a good starting size, but tweak 
#               your own install. Any feedback is welcome of what FILE_SIZE
#               works best for you. If you're storing a massive amount of data
#               I would be tempted to try 2G first.
FILE_SIZE=1G

# BUFFER_PATH   Where to keep the PCAP files. In an ideal world you would keep
#               these on their own disk(s). Fast disks and a good large RAID
#               will be your friend here.
BUFFER_PATH=/var/tmp/openfpc/pcap

# PCAP_SAPCE:   % of space on the BUFFER_PATH partition to use for PCAP 
#               storage. The bigger the storage, the bigger your historical
#               time window. I have kept the default to 50% for those who
#               try OpenFPC with the BUFFER_PATH on the same partition as /
PCAP_SPACE=50

# BPF_FILE:   An optional BPF filter to use while capturing traffic. 
#             BPF filter must be entered into the below file.
#
# BPF_FILE=/etc/openfpc/dl-bpf-filter.bpf

###############################################################################
# Session Capture
# Settings for openfpc-cxtracker and openfpc-cx2db. 
# openfpc-cxtracker: This process captures session data and writes to to file.
# openfpc-cx2db:     This process takes the session data from file, and uploads
#                    it into a DB on the OpenFPC Node.
#
# ENABLE_SESSION:    Enable connection tracking. This is separate from PCAP data.
#                    If enabled, all connections will ALSO be logged (in 
#                    addition to the openfpc-daemonlogger process). With this
#                    enabled user have the ability to *search* connections data
#                    via the web GUI. 
#                    With ENABLE_SESSION=0 PCAP data is still stored, and
#                    and can be extracted via openfpc-client, and the web GUI.
#                    
ENABLE_SESSION=0

# SESSION_DIR:       Location to store session data on disk.
SESSION_DIR=/var/tmp/openfpc/session

# ENABLE_IP_V6:       Enable the seating for IPv6 data. Requires a custom NTOA
#                     function in MySQL. See openfpc-dbamint.sh for details.
ENABLE_IP_V6=0

# SESSION_DB_*        Username, password, and Database name to store connection
#                     data.
